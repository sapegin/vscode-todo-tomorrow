## 1.3.1

- Fix stuck decorations after removing/updating todo comments created before the document was open.
- Remove config change handling (as it was causing the issue).

## 1.3.0

- Stricter matching to avoid false positives:
  - More precise matching of multiline comments.
  - Matches are now case-sensitive, and only two forms of each keyword are matched: `@pizza` or `PIZZA`.
  - Simplify the config: no need to duplicate keywords with and without `@`.

## 1.2.1

- Support LaTeX.
- Remove more unnecessary files form the package.

## 1.2.0

- Support Bash, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, and SQL (only single-line comments).
- Add `BODGE`, `KLUDGE`, `NOTE`, and `UNDONE` tags.
